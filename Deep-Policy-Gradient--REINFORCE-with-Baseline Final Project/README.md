# Cartpole-Policy-Gradient---REINFORCE-with-Baseline

REINFORCE with baseline used to balance pole in cartpole problem.  

The equations and model parameters are from Deisenroth, M.P. (2010).

The pole either begins at the zero (up) or pi (down) position.

Cart can only move in xy plane in order to balance pole.

DDPG or DQN may be more efficient ways of balancing pole due to the
gradual updating of the policy.
