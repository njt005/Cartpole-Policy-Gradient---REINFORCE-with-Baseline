# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robotics
These are a collection of RL & optimal control implementations for basic agent-environment scenarios (gridworld, inverted pendulum, and cartpole problems).  Implementations were done in MATLAB except for the final project (Deep Policy Gradient -- REINFORCE with Baseline -- Cartpole problem) which was done in python to utilize Pytorch capabilities.
