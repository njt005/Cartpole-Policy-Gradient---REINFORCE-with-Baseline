# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robotics
These are a collection of RL and optimal control implementations completed by our team within the reinforcement learning for robotics course at TUM.  Basic agent-environment scenarios (gridworld, inverted pendulum, and cartpole problems) were used to evaluate various RL and optimal control methods in order to learn and understand the advantages of each algorithm and function approximation.  Implementations were done in MATLAB except for the final project (Deep Policy Gradient -- REINFORCE with Baseline -- Cartpole problem) which was done in python to utilize Pytorch capabilities.
