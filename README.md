# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Robotics
These are a collection of RL & optimal control implementations completed by our team within the reinforcement learning for robotics course.  Basic agent-environment scenarios (gridworld, inverted pendulum, and cartpole problems) were used to evaluate various RL and optimal control methods in order to learn and understand the various algorithms.  Implementations were done in MATLAB except for the final project (Deep Policy Gradient -- REINFORCE with Baseline -- Cartpole problem) which was done in python to utilize Pytorch capabilities.
